Hello everyone!

My name is Melissa and I am a software developer! 

I'm hear today to talk about how I entered the field of computer science and what it is I do on a day to day basis.

Well, I work for a company called iQmetrix, our office is in downtown Regina with the goose scuplture in front.

iQmetrix is one of the biggest software development companies in Regina, we have about 200 employees here, about 150 of which are developers.

Our main product, what we sell, is a point of sale software called RQ - if you've ever been to Cornwall mall or heard of Jump.ca? We make their website and the system they use to sell phones and accessories.

Talking about myself specifically, I am primarily a web developer, which means I make websites and web applications.

I believe you guys have used JavaScript before? That's one of the languages I use on a daily basis, along with HTML and CSS, Ruby and Node.js.

But lets take a step back and talk about how I got into computer science. When I was your age, I had no idea Computer Science was a thing.

I was quite confident I was going to be a pharmacist, because I chemistry and biology were my favourite classes.

But then... One day my desktop publishing teacher pulled me aside and said "so, hey, how about Girls in Gaming?" of course I didn't really want to...

I loved it.

Then when I entered university I saw "intro to computer science" and decided to take it. 

The first year of CS was pretty easy, to be honest. It was mostly brand new things that I enjoyed greatly.

Second year was very, very difficult. Second year university is the "weeding out" year, you usually have to take a full course load of heavy CS classes.

However, make it to 3rd year and its much easier!

Around this time I decided to join the coop program. It was the best decision I have ever made. 

I did my first term at Manitoba Hydro, creating a web application.

Following, I did my second at iQmetrix and never left! Once I graduated I started full time.

Years later, I have my own coop from the U of R, who I interviewed, trained and created a project for.

University vs Polytech:
* Government prefers university
* At iQ, you will have to prove yourself more if you have non-uni, but you can still get a job
* More practical, better for web-dev
* Gives you a better idea of what you want to do

I want to take this time to give advice:

* NETWORKING!!! #1
* Join coop - even if you have a job. My company hires coops 10x more then non-coop - 3 interviews vs 1 easy interview
* Learn on your own - hackathons
* Have a minor - dont do pure CS

Experience in job market:
* iQ needs more competent developers badly
* Writing skills will get you VERY FAR
* Being good at an interview and having a good resume is half the battle (coop resume anacdote)
* NETWORKING!!!

Day to day:
* links
* standup
* iteration planning
* retro
* rest of day: working on tickets

Pros and cons:
* health
* benefits
* trip
* culture
* can work at any company
* people dont know what it is
* lifelong learning
* stress
* become IT person for family
* flexible work enviornment
